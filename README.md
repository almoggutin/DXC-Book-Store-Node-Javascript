<!-- ABOUT THE APPLICATION -->

## About The Application

This server-side application is is part of the DXC Book Store assignment.

It is built with Node.js and Express Framework with Javascript. In addition the application's database is MongoDB with the use of an ODM like Mongoose. Additionally the application has basic authentication and authorization functionality with the use of JWT. The application also uses Redis, to store JWT tokens for users and s3 buckets to store Book covers.

In the applicaiton we can add books to the database, edit them and delete them. Users can signup, login, edit, and delete their data. In addition, each user has their own cart, where they can store books they want to buy, and checkout if they wish too.

<!-- POSTMAN -->

## Postman

Above, there is a link that will take you to the postman files in my postman profile where you can test the api functionality in the browser.

However if you would like to run the files locally on your machine in the postman desktop application, included in the repository, in the `postman` directory all the files so you can import them. In addition you will have to configure env variables in postman so that you will be able to test properly everything.
